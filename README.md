  ## 💬 Description 
  As we know, all non-essential workers have been asked to stay home with the rise of COVID-19 cases in America. 
This means almost 70 million Americans are either at home, or possibly unemployed. 
With everyone being stuck at home these last few months, they have probably grown tired of binging the same old 
Netflix shows or podcasts, and they want something that will expand their knowledge.
Unfortunately, libraries are all closed due to the pandemic, which is where we come in. 
  At Book Brain, we bring the library to you, all while residing in the comfort of your home. 
Browse from a wide variety of books from a multitude of different genres by several authors. 
Not only can you search for books, and read them, but you can also add books to your own personal list.
Feel free to create your own account for added security. 
Book Brain works with all web browsers, but we recommend Google Chrome for the best experience. 
   Book Brain is the world's largest site for readers.
We decided to create Book Brain which will serve as an interactive platform where people can read books, 
also connect with their friends and family to see what books they are reading currently. 
Our mission is to help users find, share, review, and save books they love.
